Version: 1.0.0

Description: synon is designed to be used with large vascular plant datasets, particularly those from herbaria specimens with challenging complexity. It allows the user to define a target reference checklist or uses the 
 NatureServe Network USA/Canada taxonomic backbone by default. synon uses a hierarchical approach to taxonomic translation, beginning with direct matches to the checklist, then user provided translation tables, then built-in translation tables
 from NatureServe, USDA PLANTS, SEINet, WCVP, and GBIF. If desired, trinomial epithets are dropped from the input taxon names and binomial names are matched to user-provided and built-in tables.
 Finally, if fuzzy matching is desired, input names are matched using the rWCVP package as full names and binomials. The package currently uses scientific names without authority, but a future version
 will support the use of full scientific names with authorship.
